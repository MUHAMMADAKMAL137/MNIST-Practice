# MNIST-Practice
In my practice with the MNIST dataset, I followed the code provided in the book "Deep Learning with Python" by Fran√ßois Chollet. The code begins by importing the necessary libraries, including Keras and other dependencies.

Next, I loaded the MNIST dataset using the built-in functions in Keras. This involved splitting the dataset into training and testing sets. To prepare the data for training, I performed preprocessing steps such as reshaping the image data and normalizing pixel values. Additionally, I applied one-hot encoding to the labels.

For the model architecture, I followed the instructions in the book. I defined the structure of the deep learning model using either the sequential model or functional API in Keras. This involved specifying the type and number of layers, activation functions, and other parameters.

To compile the model, I set the optimizer, loss function, and evaluation metrics. This allowed me to configure how the model would be trained and evaluated.

I then proceeded to train the model on the MNIST training dataset. This involved specifying the number of epochs, batch size, and other training parameters. I used methods such as `fit` or custom training loops to train the model.

After training, I evaluated the model's performance on the MNIST test dataset. I calculated metrics such as accuracy or loss to assess how well the model generalized to unseen data.

Throughout the practice, I had the opportunity to visualize the results, monitor the training progress, and experiment with different hyperparameters and architectures.

Overall, practicing with the MNIST dataset using the code from "Deep Learning with Python" allowed me to gain hands-on experience in building and training deep learning models for image classification tasks. It provided a solid foundation for further exploration and experimentation in the field of deep learning.
